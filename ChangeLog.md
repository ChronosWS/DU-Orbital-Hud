## ChangeLog - Most recent changes at the top

Version 4.171 
- Added safety check to Brake landing.  If current mass * gravity at sea level > maxBrake power, it will not try an automatic Brake Landing.
- Added user variable for loss of altitude rate, brakeLandingRate, when using brake landing. Default is 30 m/s

Version 4.17 - Brake Landing
- While flying, if you have hover or vertical boosters, and you hit G, your ship will attempt to brake land.  If you are at max load of low altitude lift, or of brakes, do not use.  This does not replace hitting G for autoland while in altitude hold.  To brake land you must cancel altitude hold first.  As with most auto features, toggle brakes to turn off.

Version 4.162
- localized Nav.control.isRemoteControlled() function in unit.start and apTick 
- Only show Follow Mode button if on a Remote.  Alt-8 while on seat will give message only works when on remote.
- Hide autopilot engage button in atmo, give message if use alt-4 in atmo.
- Hide retrograde button if in atmo
- Shift to cruise control once reach takeoff altitude.

Version 4.161
- Updated new values to show n/a if out of gravity.

Version 4.16
- Ship now shows Required forward thrust for current mass at current gravity and Max Mass for max available forward thrust in current gravity.  Note this does not consider lift, just values if you pointed 90deg up.

Version 4.15
- Gyro's autoconnect again.  If you have a gyro on ship and run autoconf after it is placed, this will let you hit alt-9 the gyro will activate.  This can be used to change your controls perceived orientation from Core orientation to Gyro orientation.

Version 4.146
- Must press alt-7 2 times to wipe databank.  A wiped databank prevents saving of flight status variable.
- Attempt to fix calculation of fuelTankOptimization when setting up fuel tanks.

Version 4.145
- Fixed bugs with dimming, more elements are now undimmed when in freelook, dimmed elements are dimmer, artifical horizon is not displayed in freelook
- Fixed fuel display problem with remote control
- Readded brighthud

Version 4.144
- Track trip time and total run time on ship.

Version 4.143
- More optimization refactoring
- Fixed new DU bug with vertical engines firing constantly

Version 4.142
- More optimization refactoring from Chronos.

Version 4.141
- Fix for structural damage showing 99% when no voxels damaged.  Damage report only appears if any damage.

Version 4.14
- Updated damage report to show Structural Integrity (Voxel damage) and Element Integrity (Element damage). Element integrity still shows # of disabled and # of damaged elements.
Max Voxel integrity is set when you sit in the seat and autosaved if you have a databank attached.  To reset it you must perform normal save wipe (ALT-7) per Readme.

Version 4.13
- Added maxBrake to odometer
- Added maxThrust to odometer
- Modified mass to use function call, no need for extraMass anymore.

Version 4.126
- localized unit.getAtmosphereDensity

Version 4.125
- Added to user variables: brightHud = false --export: Enable to prevent hud dimming when in freelook.

Version 4.12
- Optimizations and fix save feature

Version 4.11
- Optimaztions with function localizations

Version 4.1 
- Major change in how html text is formatted, should result in improved performance but report any bugs.

Version 4.065
- Bug fixes.

Version 4.06
- added player variables speedChangeLarge and speedChangeSmall so you can control the rate of throttle change.  Large happens when you tap speed up or down, small happens when you hold speed up or down.
- doors and ramps will not auto open when exiting seat/remote while in space 

Version 4.05 - Odometers, Mass, and Rocket change
- Added a Trip and Lifetime odometer.  Note that trip resets if you get out of seat.  Lifetime doesnt reset unless you clear databank (and only saves with databank)
- Added Total Mass of ship, and a new user parameter extraMass because i cannot calculate honeycomb mass.  set extraMass to honeycomb mass as shown in Builder info
- Modified Rocket Engine performance.  In Cruise Mode it will fire till you reach cruise speed and then again to keep you at that speed till toggled off.  In Travel Mode it will fire continuous till you toggle it back off.

Version 4.04 - Cruise Control with Altitude Hold
- Modified alt-6 to turn on cruise control and altitude hold at same time.  Cruise speed set to current speed, altitude to current altitude.
- Use ALT-C and ALT-SPACE to change set altitude height.
- Hitting G while in altitude hold will start an autolanding like normal, but will also cancel cruise control for you.
-- Reverted 4.05 due to issues with AutoLand caused by fixing vertical engine problems

Version 4.03 More cleanups
- Cleaned  up code
- Removed vertical speed change if altitude is gone (200km)
- Cleaned up time displays and fuel location to account for planet name when in space.

Version 4.02
- Cleaned up comment lines to reduce code size.

Version 4.01
- Fixed time remaining when using multiple tanks.
- Fixed script limit issue where other players couldn't use the seat (and you had to reload it every time you relog)

Version 4.0 - More slots please  
(NOTE: This change means the default vanilla fuel widgets will no longer be shown unless you manually link fuel tanks to control chair/remote)
- Removed automatic slotting of all fuel tanks, freeing up slots for other items. Fuel percentages and time remaining are still shown.  The value for 100% will be the larger of vanilla volume or your current fuel volume when you get in the seat. 
- Added fuelTankOptimization = 0 For accurate fuel levels, set this to the fuel tank optimization level * 0.05 (so level 1 = 0.05, level 5 = 0.25) of the PERSON WHO PLACED the tank. This will be 0 for most people for now.

- Minor bugfix for when that DU bug starts your ship spinning, the ship should stop when you get out now
